Reference [1] proposes a quasinormal mode expansion theory for the optical response of the plasmonic nanoresonators with mesoscale (2-20 nm) feature sizes. The optical response of such mesoscale plasmonic nanoresonators is significantly affected by the nonlocality, surface damping and electron spill-out nonclassical quantum effects, which can be fully described by the nonclassical electromagnetic boundary condition (N-EBC) expressed with the surface-response Feibelman d parameters [2]. In the theory, the expansion expression of source-excited nonclassical electromagnetic field (under the N-EBC) are given, and the expression have a fully analytical dependence on the N-EBC and classical QNM.
