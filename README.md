# The open-source numerical tool (QNM_N-EBC) of the quasinormal mode expansion theory for mesoscale plasmonic nanoresonators proposed in Ref. [1]
Reference [1] proposes a quasinormal mode expansion theory for the optical response of the plasmonic nanoresonators with mesoscale (2-20 nm) feature sizes. The optical response of such mesoscale plasmonic nanoresonators is significantly affected by the nonlocality, surface damping and electron spill-out nonclassical quantum effects, which can be fully described by the nonclassical electromagnetic boundary condition (N-EBC) expressed with the surface-response Feibelman d parameters [2]. In the theory, the expansion expression of source-excited nonclassical electromagnetic field (under the N-EBC) are given, and the expression have a fully analytical dependence on the N-EBC and classical QNM.
# The software to run the tool
The open-source numerical tool relies on COMSOL Multiphysics software to achieve the calculation and normalization of the classical QNM, and relies on the Matlab, via the Matlab-COMSOL livelink to achieve the calculation of the expansion expression of source-excited nonclassical electromagnetic field.
# The files in the tool
The numerical tool for the calculations of total electromagnetic field (in the document named <Total field>) and scattered electromagnetic field (in the document named <Scattered field>) are both provided. Specifically, the programs in <Total field> and in <Scattered field> can be used to calculate the blue solid and blue dotted curves in Fig. 2(a2) and Fig. 3(c) in Ref. [1], respectively. In addition, the programs for the fullwave calculation with COMSOL Multiphysics software are provided, and the name of such programs ends with “fullwave_web”. With these programs, the blue circles in Fig. 2(a2) and Fig. 3(c) can be obtained.
